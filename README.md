* Web Scraping for Content Collection: Implement web scraping techniques to gather text data from specified online sources, efficiently collecting a rich dataset for analysis.
* Text Preprocessing and POS Tagging: Apply text preprocessing methods, including cleaning, normalization, and part-of-speech (POS) tagging, to identify and extract adjectives from the scraped content, preparing the data for focused analysis.
* Adjective-Focused Word Cloud Visualization: Utilize the extracted adjectives to create a word cloud visualization, effectively highlighting the most prominent descriptive terms in the dataset and providing insights into the thematic content of the text.

* This projects investigates the relative skill of components of the golf game compared to how much money PGA Tour players earn.
* The project extensively uses data visualization to communicate findings and insights .Through plots and graphs, such as scatter plots with color coding to represent different categories, the project illustrates my ability to use libraries like Plotly to create interactive and informative visualizations. This skill is essential for making complex data more accessible and understandable to stakeholders.
